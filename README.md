E-Commerce Backend System
Objective
This project is designed to create a small e-commerce backend system using Node.js and Sequelize ORM. It helps in understanding database interactions, ORM modeling, and building RESTful APIs in Node.js.

Features
User Management
Users can sign up, log in, and log out.
Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt.
JWT-based authentication for secured routes.
Product Management
Admin users can add, update, delete, and view products.
Products include fields such as:
id
name
price
description
quantity
category (linked to a Category model)
imageUrl (optional)
Shopping Cart
Authenticated users can:
Add items to their shopping cart.
View their cart with product details and total price.
Update the quantity of items in the cart.
Remove items from the cart.
Order Management
Users can place an order for items in their cart.
Order details are stored in an Order model with the following fields:
orderId
userId (relation to the User model)
products (array of product details)
totalPrice
status (e.g., pending, confirmed, shipped)
createdAt, updatedAt
Database Design
Models
